Report: Conrona Virus & World Population
Davis Lee & April Doster

Final Report:

Extract: our original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV)
We pulled two sources of data from kaggle: 
1) Novel Corona Virus 2019 Dataset.csv
2) World Population Dataset.csv

Transform: We pulled the data, sorted, used groupby and joined the data so we could compare the factors.
Corona_DataFrame
1) Filtered only the latest data (which was 2/10/2020)
2) Used groupby method in pandas so we can take "Country" as primary key

Census_DataFrame
1) Filtered only the latest data (which was 2020)
2) Used pivot method within pandas so that "Country Name" can serve as primary key
3) Used dropna method within pandas to remove NaN data

--> Merged corona_dataframe & census_dataframe on "Country" and "Country Name" as they were the primary keys of each dataframe.


Loaded: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
Our goal was to find out how many people are at potentially at risk for the Coronavirus  as of 2/20/2020:
1) Country Population
2) Urban vs Rural Population factors
3) Age Factors - (65+)
